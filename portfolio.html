        &emsp; &emsp; Probably my most successful project is Monke Bot. Which is a meme bot for discord made in python. It really started out because I used a lot of different meme bots on discord and liked different qualities about them and would like for some features to be added. I decided to make my own bot. "How hard could it be?" In this project I really learned a lot about not just python but programming in general. Skills like problem solving and persistence. The bot itself can pull memes from reddit and send them on command to play rock paper scissors with you. This bot has gained itself and I a mass following which is displayed in the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/HpEGNvur28">discord server</a>. </font></p></div>

          &emsp; &emsp; I play a lot of Minecraft in my spare time and if you play minecraft yourself, you probably know about automatic farms. For these farms to be working you have to be online your computer. There are a good amount of pre-existing AFK bots, but a lot of them have viruses and aren't safe. So, I made a solution so that I could leave my computer open and the game would run. It basically tricks the computer into thinking that you are online. In very basic terms what it does is send a signal to the computer telling it that you pressed the keyboard.</font>
